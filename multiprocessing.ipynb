    "    Multiprocessing:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1.Definition: Runs multiple processes, each with its own memory space.\n",
    "        2.Memory: Each process has its own separate memory.\n",
    "        3.Performance: True parallel execution on multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "        4.Communication: Processes communicate via complex methods like pipes or shared memory.\n",
    "        5.Use Cases: Best for heavy computations, like scientific calculations.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    Multithreading:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        1.Definition: Runs multiple threads within the same process, sharing memory.\n",
    "        2.Memory: All threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "        3.Performance: Can run concurrently, especially good for tasks waiting on I/O operations.\n",
    "        4.Communication: Easier communication between threads but needs careful synchronization.\n",
    "        5.Use Cases: Best for tasks like handling multiple web requests or file operations.\n",

    "    Summary:\n",
    "        Multiprocessing: Good for CPU-heavy tasks, more memory use, true parallelism.\n",
