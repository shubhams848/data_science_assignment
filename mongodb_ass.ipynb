    "### What is MongoDB?\n",
    "    1. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data as documents in a flexible, JSON-like format.\n",
    "    2. It’s different from traditional databases that use tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-relational Databases (NoSQL)\n",
    "    1. NoSQL databases don’t use tables like traditional databases.\n",
    "    2. They store data in various ways, like documents, key-value pairs, or graphs.\n",
    "    3. They’re good for handling large amounts of data that don’t fit neatly into tables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### When to Use MongoDB Over SQL Databases\n",
    "    1. Flexible Data Structure: When you need to change the data structure often.\n",
    "    2. Unstructured Data: For storing things like text, images, or logs that don’t fit into tables.\n",
    "    3. Scaling: When you need to easily add more servers to handle more data.\n",
    "    4. Real-Time Data: For applications that need to process lots of data quickly.\n",
    "    5. Distributed Data: When your data is spread across different locations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### When SQL is Better:\n",
    "    1.When you need strong rules for data consistency.\n",
    "    2.When you need to link data from different tables.\n",
    "    3.When your data structure is fixed and well-defined."

    "### Document-Oriented Storage:\n",
    "    Explanation: MongoDB stores data as documents in a JSON-like format (BSON). Each document is a collection of key-value pairs, allowing for complex data structures within a single record.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flexible Schema:\n",
    "    Explanation: MongoDB allows you to have a flexible schema, meaning you can store documents with different structures in the same collection. This makes it easy to adapt to changing data requirements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Scalability:\n",
    "    Explanation: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through a process called sharding, which allows large datasets to be distributed across multiple servers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### High Performance:\n",
    "    Explanation: MongoDB is designed for high performance with features like indexing, in-memory storage, and efficient data retrieval, making it suitable for real-time applications.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Rich Query Language:\n",
    "    Explanation: MongoDB offers a powerful query language that supports various operations, including filtering, sorting, and aggregating data, similar to SQL but more flexible.\n",
    "### Indexing:\n",
    "    Explanation: MongoDB supports indexing on any field within a document, improving the speed of query operations.\n",
    "### Replication:\n",
    "    Explanation: MongoDB provides data replication through replica sets, ensuring data availability and redundancy by copying data across multiple servers.\n",
    "### Aggregation Framework:\n",
    "    Explanation: MongoDB has an advanced aggregation framework that allows for complex data processing and transformation operations, like grouping and filtering.\n",
    "### Geospatial Support:\n",
    "    Explanation: MongoDB includes built-in geospatial features, allowing you to store and query location-based data efficiently.\n",
    "### Ad-Hoc Queries:\n",
    "    Explanation: MongoDB allows you to perform ad-hoc queries on your data, meaning you can search and retrieve data without predefined queries or schema."
