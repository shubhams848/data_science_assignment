    "1.The main difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression is the number of independent variables used in the model.\n",
    "2.In simple linear regression, we use one independent variable, while in multiple linear regression, we use two or more independent variables.\n",
    "3.complexity of the model. Simple linear regression models are relatively simple and easy to interpret, as they involve only two variables. Multiple linear regression models, on the other hand, are more complex and require more computational power. They also require more careful interpretation, as the relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable can be more difficult to understand.\n",

    "4.First, let’s create a simple linear regression model. We can plot the data on a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between study time and math scores.\n",
    "5.From the scatter plot, we can see that there appears to be a positive linear relationship between study time and math scores. We can then fit a linear regression line to the data to estimate the relationship between the two variables.\n",

    "9.This means that for every one-hour increase in study time, we expect the student’s math score to increase by 1.68 points, on average, holding the IQ score constant. Similarly, for every one-point increase in IQ score, we expect the student’s math score to increase by 0.26 points, on average, holding study time constant."
